        While I don't have much work experience, I've still spent a lot of time working with computers, code, and robotics.
        <br> I've participated in the First Tech Challenge robotics competition.

        <br> I've also built multiple of my own computers.

        <br> I also spend a lot of time testing game engines from Godot, Unity, and Unreal.

        <br> And in High School I participated in a local CTF competition where my school won 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place; 
        and I also led a game dev club where I taught middle schoolers about game design and development.
