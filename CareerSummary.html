    <hr>
    <p>
        I’m looking for a career in cybersecurity, and I’m currently working towards a Bachelor
of Computer Science at Florida Polytechnic University. I’m expected to graduate in
May of 2028, and afterward I plan on working on a Master’s degree. At the university,
I’m a member of the cybersecurity club and I plan on taking the cybersecurity
concentration during the course of my degree. I’ve participated in Capture The Flag
events and I have attended a talk by a senior cybersecurity professional. I also have
experience using Linux, Windows, and MacOS; as well as experience using the
terminal. I’m currently looking for real world work experience in cybersecurity through
an internship that I will attend over the summer. I intend on working as much as I can in
order to become better experienced in the field of cybersecurity, and achieving
certifications is one of my biggest goals after I obtain my degree. I’ve always had an
interest in computers and programming, and a lot of my relatives work in computer
science, which is part of the reason I’m interested in a job in cybersecurity.
